# zellay

A personal Discord theme made for my own use, derived from [ClearVision v7](https://github.com/ClearVision/ClearVision-v7).

## Changes from ClearVision

- Rebranded all references from ClearVision to zellay
- Self-hosted CSS and assets (no external ClearVision dependencies)
- Custom background image (black & gold)
- Custom font
- Custom code block styling
- Message separator styling
